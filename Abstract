Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves regularly and automatically
integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. 
The primary goal of CI is to detect and address integration issues early in the development process, 
ensuring that the software remains in a consistent and functional state. By automating the build and testing processes, 
CI helps teams deliver high-quality software more efficiently, fostering collaboration and reducing the risk of bugs and conflicts.
The continuous integration pipeline typically includes automated testing, code analysis, and deployment, 
enabling rapid feedback and facilitating a more streamlined and reliable software development lifecycle.
